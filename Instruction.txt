register a staff with info not in the database of localhost, this staff can only work for united airlines and is not an admin of united airlines.
username: Mr.SH

first_name: Eric
last_name: Yang

{#then use the above info to login as staff}
In non-admin staff homepage, you can view and search, but there are no buttons to add flights, update status, etc.

Now login as Mr.US, which is the admin of United Airlines.
Username: Mr.US
Password: 1
You can see add flights, grant permission buttons etc. And you enter grant permission to grant Mr.SH admin permission.
Then you logout and login as staff with Mr.SH (password: 1) and you see Mr.SH is now an admin.
Note that you login as Mr.US and want to grant permission to Mr.RU, but error. Since he is not from United Airlines.

Similarly, booking agent 2@nyu.com works for Rossiya airline only. And he has no permission to buy tickets of United Airlines.
Suppose if he enters the purchase ticket page from his agent homepage, and entered locations and then selected airline name
as united airlines, he will receive error message. "No permission from this airline"

And if Mr.US adds him as the booking agent of United Airlines, we can see 2@nyu.com appears in booking_agent_works_for
with airline name united airlines. Then he can login and go on to buy tickets for united airlines.
